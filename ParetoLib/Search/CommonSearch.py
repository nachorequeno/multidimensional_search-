"""CommontSearch.

This module instantiate the abstract interface Oracle.
The OraclePoint defines the boundary between the upper and lower
closures based on a discrete cloud of points. The cloud of points is
saved in a NDTree [1], a data structure that is optimised for storing
a Pareto front by removing redundant non-dominating points from the
surface. A point x that dominates every member of the Pareto front
belongs to the lower part of the monotone partition, while a point x
that is dominated by any element of the Pareto front will fall in the
upper part.
