"""Segment.

This module introduces the Segment class. It includes a set of
operations for creating and handling segments, i.e., intervals
between two Cartesian points. For instance, the diagonal of a
Rectangle is considered as a Segment object.

This class is used for storing the result of a binary search
over the diagonal of a Rectangle, i.e., the interval where a
Pareto point is located.

        A Segment is represented by a couple of Points (i.e., tuples)
        named self.low and self.high.

        Given two input Points, the attribute self.low contains
        the smallest one and self.high the greatest one.

        Points are stored as tuples of float numbers, which are
        automatically rounded to the maximal decimal precision
        specified by ParetoLib.Geometry.__numdigits__

        By using Segments as intermediate elements for initializing
        Rectangles, we guarantee that arithmetic issues caused by
        decimal precision are removed.

            self (Segment): A Segment.
